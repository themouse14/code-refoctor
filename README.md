# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## MY TASK

This code was considered a "wet-code", and needed to be reformatted to 1) make the file smaller and easier to navigate and 2) make it more available and effecient to update in the future.

.

### TO ACCOMPLISH MY TASK

I looked through the CSS file, and noticed there was a lot of supliate code. I went through it and combined into one neat package some elements that shared identical styling. Also, for ease of use, I changed some of the tags into semantic tags.

.

### WHAT THIS WILL ACCOMPLISH FOR THE USER

The User, depending on the webpage, will have a friendly user experience, and the page will load without issue at the fastest possible speed.

.

### WHAT THIS TASK WILL ACCOMPLISH FOR A CLIENT

On the front end of things, all elements will stay exactly how the client intended.

.

### WHAT THIS TASK WILL ACCOMPLISH FOR A DEVELOPER

On the back end, this formatting for the style will make it more clear for the developer to make changes, update information, or style multiple elements on a page for the client in fewer steps. Dry-coding can minimize errors and the possibility of creating files that are larger than they need to be.
